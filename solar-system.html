      <p class="mp">Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is a rocky 
        and barren world with extreme temperatures. 
        It lacks an atmosphere, resulting in scorching hot
         days and freezing cold nights.</p>

    <h4>Some Facts about Mercury:- </h4>
    <p2>1. Mercury has the greatest temperature variations in our solar system, with scorching hot daytime temperatures and freezing cold nights.<br><br>
      2. Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet. Venus holds that title due to its thick atmosphere.<br><br>
      3. Mercury has a very slow rotation, taking about 59 Earth days to complete one rotation on its axis.<br><br>
      4. It has a relatively thin atmosphere consisting mostly of trace amounts of helium and hydrogen.<br><br>
      5. Mercury is known for its long, meandering cliffs called "scarps," which are believed to be the result of the planet's cooling and shrinking over time.</p2>
